#' Get Feature Probabilities
#'
#' This function calculates the probability of each feature as a proportion of total. It sums up all the values in the MIDI matrix, calculates the summary for each column(feature), and finally computes the probability of each feature by dividing the column summary by the total summary.
#'
#' @param midi_matrix A numeric note by time feature matrix.
#'
#' @return A numeric vector containing the probabilities of each feature. The length of the vector is equal to the number of features (columns) in the input MIDI matrix.

#' Compute the mean note density of a midi matrix
#'
#' This function takes a midi matrix and returns the rounded mean of the sum of rows. Note that the round function is used to round to the nearest whole number.
#'
#' @param midi_matrix A numerical matrix where the of rows represents the MIDI notes, and the sum of each row represents the note density.
#'
#' @return A rounded integer that represents the mean note density.

#' Create New Features Based on Probabilities
#'
#' Input a sequence of probabilities and get back a new sequence based on a binomial distribution and these probabilities. Any resulting value greater than 1 in the new sequence will be set to 1.
#'
#' @param probs Numeric vector, a sequence of probabilities between 0 and 1 used to generate the new sequence.
#' @param density Integer, the number of trials (default is 6).
#' @param exmaples Inger, the number of examples to generate (default is 1)
#'
#' @return If example is 1, a sequence same length as probs but with values following a binomial distribution based on the inputted probabilities, with any values greater than 1 set to 1. If example is > 1, a matrix of sequences, with the number of columns the same length as the probabilities, and sequences corresponding to rows.
