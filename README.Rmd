The goal of `midiblender` is to mangle midi files in R and listen to what happens.

This is an experimental, use at your own frustration package. I'm writing this for my own use cases, and using the R package format because it helps me to clarify and track the goals I'm chasing down. This is an R package, but perhaps should not be confused with one.

I'm sharing this for fun and in case others find it useful.

## Installation

You can install the midiblender like so:

``` r
## install remotes package if it's not already
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}

## install dev version of rtweettree from github
remotes::install_github("CrumpLab/midiblender")
```

Aspects of this package rely on [pyramidi](https://urswilke.github.io/pyramidi/), which is also in an experimental lifecycle. That package wraps some python libraries ([miditapyr](https://pypi.org/project/miditapyr/) and [mido](https://mido.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)) that handle midi import and export. See the [pyramidi](https://urswilke.github.io/pyramidi/) documentation for more information about what is necessary to install before this will work.

## To Do

- [x] a conceptual [getting started document](https://www.crumplab.com/midiblender/articles/Getting_started.html)
- [x] Using vignettes to conduct various tests and concepts for midi blending
  - [Mangling with matrices](https://www.crumplab.com/midiblender/articles/mangling_with_matrices.html)
  - [Basic MIDI mangling functions](https://www.crumplab.com/midiblender/articles/midi_mangle.html)
  -[Midi data frame constructors with dplyr](https://www.crumplab.com/midiblender/articles/midi_construct.html)
- [] Fill out example code in the function documentation
  - Slowly adding more examples

The primary style of development here is me trying things out for fun and listening to them...with a side eye toward posterity in case the mangling pattern seems like a tool I'd want to use again.

## Thanks to

Thanks to the R community for building such wonderful tools. Special thanks to Urs Wilke for [pyramidi](https://urswilke.github.io/pyramidi/), that helped me get up to speed very quickly.
